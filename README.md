### Switchless Mods for SEGA MasterSystem and MegaDrive
---

This is a collection of earlier projects. These projects are not under development anymore. Documentation is rather simple and can be found in source code comments in most cases.

Please don't write me for any support. Please reach out to community forums and use the knowledge and experiences there.

Best Regards, Peter
